Some Mega Browser features use online services. Below, the data collected and used by these is detailed.

# News

Mega Browser offers a homepage news feed.

The feed is generated using NewsAPI. There is a piece of server side code on the Mega Browser website that looks up your IP in a database to guess the country you are in, and then calls the API using that to provide localised news. The IP is not stored anywhere or sent to 3rd parties. Localised news can be disabled in settings.

# Translation

The Reading Mode translator uses Microsoft Translate. The app sends the entire Reading Mode page to a server operated by CookieJarApps.

Each sentence from the page is seperated and sent individually to Microsoft for translation, mixed in with other user's queries.

Each sentence and its translation is then stored in a database for 14 days for a quicker translation if the same page is translated again.

Sentences can't be linked to a user and are not shared with any 3rd parties. No IP addresses are stored.


# Search Suggestions

Mega Browser offers a custom search suggestion system (disabled by default). Your IP address is used to provide results relevant to your country. Queries made to the server for suggestions are not stored.

No data about searches or queries entered into the search field are stored anywhere.
